# Password-Generator

## Description 

This application randomly generates a password based on the parameters provided by the user. The password must be between 8-128 characters and can include a mixture of uppercase letters, lowercase, letters, numbers, and special characters. The user will indicate their preference by answering prompts delivered to them.

## User Instructions

The user will need to click on the "Generate Password" button to begin the process. They will be asked to indicate the length of the password, whether they would like to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers and/or special characters. If a used does not select any of these options an alert message will indicate the password is unable to be generated without any characters. The user will then be asked the same questions over again.  Once this process is completed a password will appear in the "Your Secure Password" text box.
